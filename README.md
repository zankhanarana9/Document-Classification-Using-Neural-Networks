# Document-Classification-Using-Neural-Networks
# The program takes text files as input and runs the main program that performs preprocessing on the input documents.
# Preprocesing steps includes removal of Stopwords, Stemming using Porter Stemmer algorithm.
# The next step is to find the keywords from unclassified documents.
# Apply the trained Neural networks (USing back propgation algorithm) set on the extracted keywords to classify the documents in the domain of Physics, Chemistry or biology.
