chemistry amphoteric species molecule ion react acid well base word derived Greek word amphoteroi fte meaning Many metals copper zinc tin lead aluminium beryllium form amphoteric oxides hydroxides Amphoterism depends oxidation state oxide ### type amphoteric species amphiprotic molecules either donate accept proton H Examples include amino acids proteins amine carboxylic acid groups selfionizable compounds water ammonia Ampholytes amphoteric molecules contain acidic basic groups exist mostly zwitterions certain range pH pH average charge known molecules isoelectric point Ampholytes used establish stable pH gradient use isoelectric focusing ### According BrnstedLowry theory acids bases acids proton donors bases proton acceptors amphiprotic molecule ion either donate accept proton thus acting either acid base Water amino acids hydrogen carbonate ions hydrogen sulfate ions common examples amphiprotic species Since donate proton amphiprotic substances contain hydrogen atom since act like acid base amphoteric ###
